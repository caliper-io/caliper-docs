## Visitor tracking

Each trace stored in Caliper is associated with a unique visitor
(user) to your application. This allows us to measure the performance on
everything a visitor performs in your front end application.

To diagnose performance issues related to your users, [associate an email
address or name to each trace](/configuration.html#visitor) and your users
will begin to appear under the "Visitors" section for your app.

### Search & Browse Visitors

See the [config variable](/configuration.html#visitor) to add visitor names
or emails to traces.

After this has been configured and deployed you will be able to search for a name under the
visitors section on Caliper.

The avatar images shown for your visitors are using the [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com)
service.

We're always looking for ways to improve our reporting. Please feel free to send any
[feedback](mailto:team@caliper.io) you may have.

## Visitor tracking

Each trace stored in Caliper is associated with a unique visitor
(user) to your application. This allows us to measure the performance on
everything a visitor performs in your front end application.

To diagnose performance issues for your users simply
associate an email address or name to each trace and then under visitors
for your application.

### Search & Browse Visitors

Check out our [configuration variable](/configuration.html#visitor) 
to add visitor names or emails to traces.

After this has been configured and deployed you will be able to search for a name under the
visitors section on Caliper.

The avatar images shown for your visitors are using the
[Gravatar](http://gravatar.com)
service.

Please send us any [feedback](mailto:team@caliper.io) you may have on
our visitor tracking.

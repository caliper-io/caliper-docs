## Introduction

Caliper monitors the performance of your webapps in production.
We focus solely on applications developed in JS that run in the browser or mobile containers. These may be referred to as 'webapps' or 'single page applications'.

Caliper is designed to be HTML5 __framework aware__ which means we integrate
with applications written in popular MV\* frameworks with little to no effort or
configuration.

### Framework support

We currently support <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">BackboneJS</a> and <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember.js</a>. We have Angular support coming soon!

### I want support for framework X

If you're interested in instrumenting another application framework then let us know.
We prioritize our roadmap based on the feedback from the community.

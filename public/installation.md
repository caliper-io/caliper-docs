## Installation

To install Caliper simply follow the instructions under the setup page from under your application in [Caliper](http://caliper.io).

As an overview you follow these three simple steps.

1. Configure your api key
2. Insert our framework plugin after your framework has been initialized and before your application code
3. Optionally add names to parts of your application so that the Caliper dashboard is better detailed
